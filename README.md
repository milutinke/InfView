# InfView

## About
InfView is a student project from the Software Design Course on 2nd year on Racunarski Fakultet, University Union in Belgrade, Serbia.
Its purpose is to provide an abstraction with data manipulation to make data manipulation easy for ordinary/non-technical users.
It means that you can write a specification in JSON called "Meta Scheme" for your Data Base and load it in and the program will parse it and setup itself according to your database.
You can load in multiple databases at the same time.
